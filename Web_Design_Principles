Introduction to Web Design

	•	Pillars of Great Design:

	⁃	color theory
	⁃	typography
	⁃	UI Design
	⁃	UX Design

Color Theory

	red- love, energy, intensity

	yellow- joy, intellect, attention

	green- freshness, safety, growth

	blue- stability, trust, serenity

	purple- wealth, royalty, femininity 


	combining colors
	•	analogous- next to each other on the wheel	
	⁃	great for navbars, body, logo and background
	⁃	does not stand out
	•	complimentary- opposite each other on the wheel
	⁃	great for popping out
	⁃	not great for text and background!

Typography

	•	serif
	⁃	serious, authoritative, older
	⁃	more modern?
	⁃	difference between thickest and thinnest parts of each letter
	⁃	larger difference—> more modern
	•	sans-serif
	⁃	sensible, simple, straightforward
	⁃	more readable, less time to take in information 
	⁃	legibility?
	⁃	open shapes
	ex)	how open is “a”, “c”
	⁃	ample intercharacter spacing
	⁃	unambiguous forms
	⁃	“g” vs. “9”
	⁃	varying proportions
	⁃	“O” vs. “0”
	•	2 fonts per design
	⁃	keep similar:
	⁃	mood
	⁃	time era
	⁃	contrast:
	⁃	serif-ness
	⁃	weights

User Interface Design

1) Hierarchy
	- convey most important information first
	* we are drawn first to big, bold, squarer things
	
	- established through:

	•	color
	⁃	high contrast to most important
	•	size
	⁃	bigger items most important

2) Layout
	- more interest by interspersing blocks of text with images

	- chop content into smaller pieces 

	-ideal length per line of text: 40-60 characters 

3) Alignment 
	* how you position elements, relative to each other

	- ex) title and body same alignment

	- less alignment points = best!!!

4) White Space
	* empty space around text or elements 

	-minimalism!!!!

5) Audience
	* appeal to your audience 

User Experience Design
1) Simplicity
	* less is more!

2) Consistency
	* in design and functionality 

3) Reading Patterns
	*F pattern

	- most important things should track down left gutter
	- spreads out in importance to the right 

	*Z pattern
	-left to right, diagonal to bottom left, diagonal to bottom right
	-great for sparse pages, with videos
	ex) Facebook 

4) All Platform Design
	*responsivity for tablets and phones!
